## QUESTION 3 [6 marks]

Write a function called `drawBoxPlot` that takes in a single input that is labelled `df`, an $N \times m$ data frame containing *numeric* data. This function should produce a single figure with $m$ boxplots that share a common scale.

- Use the `boxplot.stats` to find the points for the figures. 
- Use the first 4 columns of the Iris data-set (length and width of sepals and petals) to demonstrate the `drawBoxPlot` function.

```{r}
drawBoxPlot <- function(df){
  boxPlot <- boxplot(df)
  return(boxPlot)
}

drawBoxPlot(iris[, c(1:4)])
```

boxplot(faithful)
