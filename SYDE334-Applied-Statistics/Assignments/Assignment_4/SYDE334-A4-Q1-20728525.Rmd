### Question One

#### a) 

$$\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y = (X'X)^{-1}X'(X\beta + \epsilon) = \beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'\epsilon$$
$$E(\hat{\beta}) = E(\beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'\epsilon) = \beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'E(\epsilon)$$
$$E(\epsilon) = 0$$
Therefore:

$$\beta + (X'X)^{-1}X'(0) = \beta$$
$$E(\hat{\beta}) =  \beta$$
The LSE of $\hat{\beta}$ under the incorrect model is still an unbiased estimator.

#### b)

Yes we still have the result of $E(r) = 0$ under the incorrect model
